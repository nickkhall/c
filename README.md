# C++ Projects

----------------------------------

## Snake Game (WIP)
**This game needs a complete re-write. I started writing this when I was beggining to learn C++.\n
**With more understanding of OOP C++, I will be re-writing this soon.\n
**IM SORRY FOR ALL THE CODE BEING IN HEADER FILES X.X

**To run the game, open terminal, navigate to SnakeGame directory and run the following:**

`clear && make compile && clear && ./bin/SnakeGame`

**Controls:**
- WASD = Up, Left, Down, Right
- ESC KEY = Quit game

## Hello World Example (Some genius stuff going on in there)
