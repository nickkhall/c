# C++ Projects

----------------------------------

## Snake Game (WIP)
**To run the game, open terminal, navigate to `snake_game` directory and run the following:**

`clear && make compile && clear && ./SnakeGame/bin/SnakeGame`

**Controls:**
- WASD = Up, Left, Down, Right
- ESC KEY = Quit game

This currently has no collision detection.

I am also still learning C++, so go easy on me ;) lol
